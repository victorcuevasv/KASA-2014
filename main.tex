% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).

% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and

\begin{abstract}

This paper presents our approach for specifying, transforming, and enacting data-centric workflows in a service-oriented environment. First, we propose ASASEL (Abstract State Machines Execution Language) a language and system based on the ASM formalism for specifying workflows consisting of on-demand and streaming data services that produce data, which are then processed by simple and composite computation services. Second, we present our initial characterization of a planning-based approach for the transformation of workflows. According to this approach, a search space of equivalent workflows that satisfy the same functional requirements but differ in respect to quality of service criteria represented by a goal is generated. In particular, we address the exploration of parallelism trough the workflow structure. Together, our language and enactment engine along with our transformation approach provide the foundation for a highly flexible mechanism for managing data-centric workflows, and which can also be adapted to other domains such as business processes or eScience.

%	In this paper we presented the constraints for generating query workflows that model the plans of hybrid queries.
%	The constraints represent the semantics of query workflow activities that is that implement data operators for evaluating a hybrid query.
%	We used the action language DLV-K for modeling the planing problem of query workflow generation in order to get a first (and naive) search space generation towards the optimization of hybrid queries.
%	The results show that time complexity for query workflow generation is exponential. 
%      
%	The constraints must be extended in order to consider the continuous data operators for completely modeling hybrid queries.
%	These constraints can be taken to model a more sophisticated query workflow generation.
%	This implies the abstraction of data operators types and their associated constraints in a general form. 
%
%	Theoretically, query workflow generation can be modeled mathematically by taking the constraints presented here and modeling an objective function.
%	Additionally, the equivalence and coherence of query workflows must be proved.
