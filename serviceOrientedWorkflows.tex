We introduce our approach with a prototypical Friend Finder application, although our approach can be applied to a broader range of applications. Consider a scenario in which multiple users are in an urban area carrying GPS-enabled mobile devices that periodically transmit their location; furthermore, they have agreed to share some of their personal information. A user in this scenario may want to \textit{Find friends recently located no more than 3 km away from me, which are over 21 years old and that are interested in art}.

Data services produce data in one of two ways: on-demand in response to a given request, or continuously as a data stream. In either case, the data service exposes an interface, composed of several operations and supported by standardized protocols. The JavaScript Object Notation\footnote{JSON http://www.json.org/} is used to represent the data. Accordingly, objects are built from atomic values, nested tuples, and lists.
	
For instance, in our scenario the users' location is available by a stream data service with the interface
	
$\mathtt{subscribe() \rightarrow \lceil location:\langle nickname, coor\rangle\rceil}$
	
consisting of a subscription operation that after invocation will produce a stream of location tuples, each with a nickname that identifies the user and his/her coordinates. The rest of the data is produced by the next two on-demand data services, each represented by a single operation
	
$\mathtt{profile(nickname) \rightarrow person:\langle age, sex, email\rangle}$
\\
$\mathtt{interests(nickname) \rightarrow \left[s\_tag:\langle tag, score\rangle\right]}$
	
	
The first provides a single person tuple denoting a profile of the user, once given a request represented by her nickname. The second produces, given the nickname as well, a list of s\_tag tuples denoting the interests of the user by scored tags (\eg{} 'music' with 8.5).
	
In order to obtain the desired result we need to give to it an executable form, in our case a workflow of activities implementing a service coordination. Workflows are built by the parallel and sequential composition of activities that are bound to data and computation services; the first provide the data, while the latter process them as required.

\subsection{Workflow Model}\label{subsec:workflowModel}

The workflow is specified as an Abstract State Machine (ASM) \cite{Gurevich:1995:EAL:233976.233979}, which can be represented as a series-parallel graph. The ASM specification of the service coordination corresponding to our example application is presented in Listing \ref{WorkflowListing}, while its workflow representation is given in Figure \ref{fig:servCoorExample}. It includes the location, profile, and interests data services, as well as computation services for various relational operations such as selections, joins, and a time-based window bounding the location stream to recent data (e.g. location notifications obtained within the last 10 minutes).

            endseq
            profile := profile.profile()
         endpar
         lp := comp.bindJoin(distSel,profile,nickname=nickname)
         ageSel := comp.selection(lp,age > 21)
      endseq
      interests := i.interests()
   endpar
   lip := comp.bindJoin(lp,interests,nickname=nickname)
   tagSel := comp.selection(lip,tag='art')
   output := comp.output(tagSel)
endseq
\end{lstlisting}

Concretely, a workflow $W$ is modeled as a directed acyclic graph \textit{W=(V, E, init, finish, A, O)} where:
		\begin{center}
			\footnotesize
			\begin{tabular}{rp{5.5cm}}
				$V$                      & is a set of vertices \\
				$E \subseteq V \times V$ & is a set of edges \\
				$A \subseteq V$          & is a set of activities \\
				$\{init, finish\} \subseteq A$     & are the initial and final activities of $W$\\
				$O \subseteq V$          & is a set of workflow composition operators $\{seq_1,...,seq_m,par_1,...,par_n\}$\\.     
			\end{tabular}   
		\end{center}
There are three types of vertices: \textit{activities} perform a service method invocation and always have ancestor and descendant vertices, \textit{init} vertices have no ancestors and their only goal is to launch the first \textit{activity} of the workflow, \textit{finish} vertices have no descendants and stop the workflow execution after the last \textit{activity}.

\subsection{Computation services}\label{subsec:computationServices}

Two kinds of computation services form part of our approach: simple computation services and composite computation services specified in the ASASEL language.

      \scalebox{0.925}{\includegraphics[natwidth=12.31cm,natheight=7.16cm]{Images/time-based-window.pdf}}
   \end{center}
   \caption{Workflow representation of the time-based window}
   \label{fig:timeBasedWindowWF}
\end{figure*}

\textbf{Simple computation services}  involve a single service operation invocation to process data. For instance, a distance computation service that relies on a \texttt{geo-distance} service, which provides the capability to calculate the geographical distance between two points, e.g., by Vincenty's formula.

\textbf{Composite computation services}  process data by multiple operation invocations, possibly from different services, and often also by the manipulation of local data. These tasks are organized in a service coordination specified in the ASASEL language and represented as a workflow, following a model in which we add data items as well as conditional and iteration constructs to our basic parallel and sequential composition workflow model illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:servCoorExample}.
		
The specification of a time-based window composite service in ASASEL is presented in Listing \ref{TimeWindowListing}, based on a simple \texttt{calendar-queue} service. Its corresponding workflow representation is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:timeBasedWindowWF}.
		
\lstset{language=AbStM,showstringspaces=false}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={ASM specification for the time-based window},label=TimeWindowListing]
if( ctl_state = 'active')
  seq
     inTuple := readTuple()
     if(inTuple = nil)
        skip
     else
        seq
           oldTuple := cq.peekFirst()
           iterate(oldTuple != nil)
              if(oldTuple.ts + range < inTuple.ts)
                 seq
                    oldTuple.sign := -1
                    oldTuple.ts := oldTuple.ts + range
                    output(oldTuple)
                    cq.removeFirst()
                    oldTuple := cq.peekFirst()
                 endseq
           pq.enqueue(inTuple)
           output(inTuple)
        endseq
  endseq
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Workflow graph construction rules}

We now present the construction rules that enable to generate a workflow graph from a given ASM. In the following definition we make the assumption that the vertices representing rules and conditions have annotations that make those vertices unique, whereas the $par$ and $endpar$ vertices of parallel compositions are made unique using labels $l$ that can be generated automatically.

\vspace*{0.25cm}
\noindent \textbf{ASM workflow graph}. For an ASM $M$, the function \textit{asmwfg} specifies the \textit{ASM workflow graph} such that \textit{asmwfg}$(M) = (V, E, in, out)$, as follows. We use $R$ to represent rules of different types. Due to space restrictions we limit our presentation to the update, parallel composition, and sequential composition rules, in that order.

\begin{equation*}
	\text{if $R = \ f := g(t_1,...,t_n)$ then}
	\begin{cases}
			\text{$V = \{R, in, out\}$}\\
			\text{$E = \{(in, R), (R, out)\}$}\\
			\text{$in$, $out$ are new vertices}\\
	\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
	\text{if $R = \ \textbf{par} R_1 ... R_n \textbf{endpar}$ then}
	\begin{cases}
			\text{Let \textit{asmwfg}$(R_i) = (V_i, E_i, in_i, out_i)$, for all $i \in [1..n]$}\\
			\text{$V = (V_1 - \{out_1\}) \cup \bigcup \limits_{j=2}^{n-1}{(V_j - (\{in_j, out_j\}))}$}\\
			\text{$\cup \ (V_n - \{in_n\}) \cup  \{par_l, endpar_l\}$}\\
			\text{$E = \{(in_1, par_l), (endpar_l, out_n)\}$}\\
			\text{$\cup \bigcup \limits_{j=1}^{n}{E_j - \{(in_j, v_j), (v_j', out_j) | v_j, v_j' \in V_j\}} $}\\
			\text{$\cup \bigcup \limits_{j=1}^{n}{\{(par_l, v_j) | (in_j, v_j) \in E_j\}} $}\\
			\text{$\cup \bigcup \limits_{j=1}^{n}{\{(v_j', endpar_l) | (v_j', out_j) \in E_j\}} $}\\
			\text{$par_l$, $endpar_l$ are new vertices defined with the label $l$}\\
			\text{also $in = in_1$ and $out = out_2$;}\\
	\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
	\text{if $R = \ \textbf{seq} R_1 ... R_n \textbf{endseq}$ then}
	\begin{cases}
			\text{Let \textit{asmwfg}$(R_i) = (V_i, E_i, in_i, out_i)$, for all $i \in [1..n]$}\\
			\text{$V = (V_1 - \{out_1\}) \cup \bigcup \limits_{j=2}^{n-1}{(V_j - (\{in_j, out_j\}))}$}\\
			\text{$\cup \ (V_n - \{in_n\})$}\\
			\text{$E = \{(in_1, v_1) | (in_1, v_1) \in E_1\} \cup \{(v_n, out_n) | (v_n, out_n) \in E_n\}$}\\
			\text{$\cup \bigcup \limits_{j=1}^{n}{E_j - \{(in_j, v_j), (v_j', out_j) | v_j, v_j' \in V_j\}} $}\\
			\text{$\cup \bigcup \limits_{j=1}^{n-1}{\{(v_j, v_{j+1}') | (v_j, out_j) \in E_j, (in_{j+1}, v_{j+1}') \in E_{j+1}\}} $}\\
			\text{where $in = in_1$ and $out = out_n$;}\\
	\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
