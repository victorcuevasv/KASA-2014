In this paper we presented a language and system for the specification and enactment of data-centric workflows based on service composition. In addition, we introduced a planning-based approach for the generation of the search space of workflow transformations. Concretely, we proposed a set of constraints modeled in an action language, specifically DLV-K, in order to characterize the transformation of workflows with sequential and parallel compositions. This work is envisaged to be a foundation for incorporating a full cost model that covers the specification of composite computation services, leading to the selection of the most suitable workflow w.r.t. the user's preferences. Future work involves incorporating the cost model, while also exploring alternative encodings and planning systems to obtain better performance.
