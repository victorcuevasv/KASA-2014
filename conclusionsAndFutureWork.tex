In this paper we focused on the generation of the search space of data-centric workflows in service-oriented environments. We proposed a set of constraints modeled in an action language, specifically DLV-K, in order to characterize the construction of workflows with sequential and parallel compositions.This work is envisaged to be a foundation for incorporating a full cost model, leading to the selection of the most suitable workflow w.r.t. user's preferences. This is crucial because in the absence of constraints the search space is in the order of $n!$ permutations in the number of activities required for obtaining the result.
