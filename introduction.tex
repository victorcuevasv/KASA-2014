The advances in mobile computing and communication technologies bring promises of timely and inexpensive access to information, as well as of increasing interaction between people and software agents. Service-oriented architectures play a crucial role in these developments, since they  deal with the interoperability issues of the underlying systems.

We note in particular the proliferation of streaming and on-demand data services for accessing data pertaining to a multitude of domains, and possibly involving temporal and mobile properties. The availability of data services is accompanied by a democratization in access to computational resources. Nevertheless, users typically must rely on proprietary applications that delegate data processing to their backend, which makes it difficult to share resources and add new features.	
	
We propose instead ASASEL (Abstract State Machines Execution Language) to build up systems from shared resources accessible as services via workflow specifications. Our work considers both on-demand and streaming data services in conjunction with the ability to construct composite computation services. 
%ASASEL also has the advantage of being based on a solid formalism and having a fully congruent visual representation. 
%also we consider it to be more user friendly than XML-based languages. 
In addition, we propose a workflow generation framework based on planning techniques to meet quality of service goals. An implementation of this framework is presented covering data-centric workflows.
