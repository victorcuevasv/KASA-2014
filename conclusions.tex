In this paper we presented a language and system for the specification and enactment of data-centric workflows based on service composition. In addition, we introduced a planning-based approach for the generation of the search space of workflows implementing requirements specifications. Concretely, we proposed a set of constraints modeled in an action language, specifically DLV-K, in order to characterize the transformation of workflows with sequential and parallel compositions. This work is envisaged to be a foundation for incorporating a full cost model that covers the specification of composite computation services, leading to the selection of the most suitable workflow w.r.t. the user's preferences.
